abstract="Evolving Knowledge Ecosystems were proposed to approach the Big Data challenge, following the hypothesis that knowledge evolves in a way similar to biological systems. Therefore, the inner working of the knowledge ecosystem can be spotted from natural evolution. An evolving knowledge ecosystem consists of Knowledge Organisms, which form a representation of the knowledge, and the environment in which they reside. The environment consists of contexts, which are composed of so-called knowledge tokens. These tokens are ontological fragments extracted from information tokens, in turn, which originate from the streams of information flowing into the ecosystem. In this article we investigate the use of LSH Forest (a self-tuning indexing schema based on locality-sensitive hashing) for solving the problem of placing new knowledge tokens in the right contexts of the environment. We argue and show experimentally that LSH Forest possesses required properties and could be used for large distributed set-ups. Further, we show experimentally that for our type of data minhashing works better than random hyperplane hashing. This paper is an extension of the paper ``Balanced Large Scale Knowledge Matching Using LSH Forest'' presented at the International Keystone Conference 2015.",

abstract="The environments, in which we all live, are known to be complex and unpredictable. The complete discovery of these environments aiming to take full control over them is a ``mission-impossible'', however, still in our common agenda. People intend to make their living spaces smarter utilizing innovations from the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as very dynamic, autonomous and intelligent things capable to discover and control large areas are becoming important ``inhabitants'' within existing and future smart cities. Our concern in this paper is to challenge the potential of UAVs in situations, which are evolving fast in a way unseen before, e.g., emergency situations. To address such challenges, UAVs have to be ``intelligent'' enough to be capable to autonomously and in near real-time evaluate the situation and its dynamics. Then, they have to discover their own missions and set-up suitable own configurations to perform it. This configuration is the result of flexible plans which are created in mutual collaboration. Finally, the UAVs execute the plans and learn from the new experiences for future reuse. However, if to take into account also the Big Data challenge, which is naturally associated with the smart cities, UAVs must be also ``wise'' in a sense that the process of making autonomous and responsible real-time decisions must include continuous search for a compromise between efficiency (acceptable time frame to get the decision and reasonable resources spent for that) and effectiveness (processing as much of important input information as possible and to improve the quality of the decisions). To address such a ``skill'' we propose to perform the required computations using Cloud Computing enhanced with Semantic Web technologies and potential tools (``agile'' deep learning) for compromising, such as, e.g., focusing, filtering, forgetting, contextualizing, compressing and connecting.",

abstract="Vector space embeddings have been shown to perform well when using RDF data in data mining and machine learning tasks. Existing approaches, such as RDF2Vec, use local information, i.e., they rely on local sequences generated for nodes in the RDF graph. For word embeddings, global techniques, such as GloVe, have been proposed as an alternative. In this paper, we show how the idea of global embeddings can be transferred to RDF embeddings, and show that the results are competitive with traditional local techniques like RDF2Vec.",

abstract="A promising pathway for natural language question answering over knowledge graphs (KG-QA) is to translate natural language questions into graph-structured queries. During the translation, a vital process is to map entity/relation phrases of natural language questions to the vertices/edges of underlying knowledge graphs which can be used to construct target graph-structured queries. However, due to linguistic flexibility and ambiguity of natural language, the mapping process is challenging and has been a bottleneck of KG-QA models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called KemQA, which stands on recent advances in relation phrase dictionaries and knowledge graph embedding techniques to address the mapping problem and construct graph-structured queries of natural language questions. Extensive experiments were conducted on question answering benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",
