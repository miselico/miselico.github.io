abstract="Evolving Knowledge Ecosystems were proposed to approach the Big Data challenge, following the hypothesis that knowledge evolves in a way similar to biological systems. Therefore, the inner working of the knowledge ecosystem can be spotted from natural evolution. An evolving knowledge ecosystem consists of Knowledge Organisms, which form a representation of the knowledge, and the environment in which they reside. The environment consists of contexts, which are composed of so-called knowledge tokens. These tokens are ontological fragments extracted from information tokens, in turn, which originate from the streams of information flowing into the ecosystem. In this article we investigate the use of LSH Forest (a self-tuning indexing schema based on locality-sensitive hashing) for solving the problem of placing new knowledge tokens in the right contexts of the environment. We argue and show experimentally that LSH Forest possesses required properties and could be used for large distributed set-ups. Further, we show experimentally that for our type of data minhashing works better than random hyperplane hashing. This paper is an extension of the paper ``Balanced Large Scale Knowledge Matching Using LSH Forest'' presented at the International Keystone Conference 2015.",

abstract="The environments, in which we all live, are known to be complex and unpredictable. The complete discovery of these environments aiming to take full control over them is a ``mission-impossible'', however, still in our common agenda. People intend to make their living spaces smarter utilizing innovations from the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as very dynamic, autonomous and intelligent things capable to discover and control large areas are becoming important ``inhabitants'' within existing and future smart cities. Our concern in this paper is to challenge the potential of UAVs in situations, which are evolving fast in a way unseen before, e.g., emergency situations. To address such challenges, UAVs have to be ``intelligent'' enough to be capable to autonomously and in near real-time evaluate the situation and its dynamics. Then, they have to discover their own missions and set-up suitable own configurations to perform it. This configuration is the result of flexible plans which are created in mutual collaboration. Finally, the UAVs execute the plans and learn from the new experiences for future reuse. However, if to take into account also the Big Data challenge, which is naturally associated with the smart cities, UAVs must be also ``wise'' in a sense that the process of making autonomous and responsible real-time decisions must include continuous search for a compromise between efficiency (acceptable time frame to get the decision and reasonable resources spent for that) and effectiveness (processing as much of important input information as possible and to improve the quality of the decisions). To address such a ``skill'' we propose to perform the required computations using Cloud Computing enhanced with Semantic Web technologies and potential tools (``agile'' deep learning) for compromising, such as, e.g., focusing, filtering, forgetting, contextualizing, compressing and connecting.",

abstract="Vector space embeddings have been shown to perform well when using RDF data in data mining and machine learning tasks. Existing approaches, such as RDF2Vec, use local information, i.e., they rely on local sequences generated for nodes in the RDF graph. For word embeddings, global techniques, such as GloVe, have been proposed as an alternative. In this paper, we show how the idea of global embeddings can be transferred to RDF embeddings, and show that the results are competitive with traditional local techniques like RDF2Vec.",

abstract="A promising pathway for natural language question answering over knowledge graphs (KG-QA) is to translate natural language questions into graph-structured queries. During the translation, a vital process is to map entity/relation phrases of natural language questions to the vertices/edges of underlying knowledge graphs which can be used to construct target graph-structured queries. However, due to linguistic flexibility and ambiguity of natural language, the mapping process is challenging and has been a bottleneck of KG-QA models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called KemQA, which stands on recent advances in relation phrase dictionaries and knowledge graph embedding techniques to address the mapping problem and construct graph-structured queries of natural language questions. Extensive experiments were conducted on question answering benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",

	abstract = {Question answering over knowledge graphs (KGQA) has evolved from simple single-fact questions to complex questions that require graph traversal and aggregation. We propose a novel approach for complex KGQA that uses unsupervised message passing, which propagates confidence scores obtained by parsing an input question and matching terms in the knowledge graph to a set of possible answers. First, we identify entity, relationship, and class names mentioned in a natural language question, and map these to their counterparts in the graph. Then, the confidence scores of these mappings propagate through the graph structure to locate the answer entities. Finally, these are aggregated depending on the identified question type. This approach can be efficiently implemented as a series of sparse matrix multiplications mimicking joins over small local subgraphs. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art on the LC-QuAD benchmark. Moreover, we show that the performance of the approach depends only on the quality of the question interpretation results, i.e., given a correct relevance score distribution, our approach always produces a correct answer ranking. Our error analysis reveals correct answers missing from the benchmark dataset and inconsistencies in the DBpedia knowledge graph. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach accompanied with an ablation study and an error analysis, which showcase the pitfalls for each of the question answering components in more detail.},

At the core of the construction is to deduce the structure of the target query and determine the vertices/edges which constitute the query. Existing query construction methods rely on question understanding and conventional graph-based algorithms which lead to inefficient and degraded performances facing complex natural language questions over knowledge graphs with large scales. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a novel framework standing on recent knowledge graph embedding techniques. Our framework first encodes the underlying knowledge graph into a low-dimensional embedding space by leveraging generalized local knowledge graphs. Given a natural language question, the learned embedding representations of the knowledge graph are utilized to compute the query structure and assemble vertices/edges into the target query. Extensive experiments were conducted on the benchmark dataset, and the results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models regarding effectiveness and efficiency.},

	abstract = "{Clustering is central to many data-driven bioinformatics research and serves a powerful computational method. In particular, clustering helps at analyzing unstructured and high-dimensional data in the form of sequences, expressions, texts and images. Further, clustering is used to gain insights into biological processes in the genomics level, e.g. clustering of gene expressions provides insights on the natural structure inherent in the data, understanding gene functions, cellular processes, subtypes of cells and understanding gene regulations. Subsequently, clustering approaches, including hierarchical, centroid-based, distribution-based, density-based and self-organizing maps, have long been studied and used in classical machine learning settings. In contrast, deep learning (DL)-based representation and feature learning for clustering have not been reviewed and employed extensively. Since the quality of clustering is not only dependent on the distribution of data points but also on the learned representation, deep neural networks can be effective means to transform mappings from a high-dimensional data space into a lower-dimensional feature space, leading to improved clustering results. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art DL-based approaches for cluster analysis that are based on representation learning, which we hope to be useful, particularly for bioinformatics research. Further, we explore in detail the training procedures of DL-based clustering algorithms, point out different clustering quality metrics and evaluate several DL-based approaches on three bioinformatics use cases, including bioimaging, cancer genomics and biomedical text mining. We believe this review and the evaluation results will provide valuable insights and serve a starting point for researchers wanting to apply DL-based unsupervised methods to solve emerging bioinformatics research problems.}",

	abstract = {Interference between pharmacological substances can cause serious medical injuries. Correctly predicting so-called drug-drug interactions (DDI) does not only reduce these cases but can also result in a reduction of drug development cost. Presently, most drug-related knowledge is the result of clinical evaluations and post-marketing surveillance; resulting in a limited amount of information. Existing data-driven prediction approaches for DDIs typically rely on a single source of information, while using information from multiple sources would help improve predictions. Machine learning (ML) techniques are used, but the techniques are often unable to deal with skewness in the data. Hence, we propose a new ML approach for predicting DDIs based on multiple data sources. For this task, we use 12,000 drug features from DrugBank, PharmGKB, and KEGG drugs, which are integrated using Knowledge Graphs (KGs). To train our prediction model, we first embed the nodes in the graph using various embedding approaches. We found that the best performing combination was a ComplEx embedding method creating using PyTorch-BigGraph (PBG) with a Convolutional-LSTM network and classic machine learning-based prediction models. The model averaging ensemble method of three best classifiers yields up to 0.94, 0.92, 0.80 for AUPR, F1 F1-score, and MCC, respectively during 5-fold cross-validation tests.},

	abstract="While RDF data are graph shaped by nature, most traditional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms expect data in a vector form. To transform graph elements to vectors, several graph embedding approaches have been proposed. Comparing these approaches is interesting for 1) developers of new embedding techniques to verify in which cases their proposal outperforms the state-of-art and 2) consumers of these techniques in choosing the best approach according to the task(s) the vectors will be used for. The comparison could be delayed (and made difficult) by the choice of tasks, the design of the evaluation, the selection of models, parameters, and needed datasets. We propose GEval, an evaluation framework to simplify the evaluation and the comparison of graph embedding techniques. The covered tasks range from ML tasks (Classification, Regression, Clustering), semantic tasks (entity relatedness, document similarity) to semantic analogies. However, GEval is designed to be (easily) extensible. In this article, we will describe the design and development of the proposed framework by detailing its overall structure, the already implemented tasks, and how to extend it. In conclusion, to demonstrate its operating approach, we consider the parameter tuning of the KGloVe algorithm as a use case.",

To improve the process of manually inserting new facts, the Wikidata platform features an association rule-based tool to recommend additional suitable properties. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to provide such recommendations based on frequentist inference. We introduce a trie-based method that can efficiently learn and represent property set probabilities in RDF graphs. We extend the method by adding type information to improve recommendation precision and introduce backoff strategies which further increase the performance of the initial approach for entities with rare property combinations. We investigate how the captured structure can be employed for property recommendation, analogously to the Wikidata PropertySuggester. We evaluate our approach on the full Wikidata dataset and compare its performance to the state-of-the-art Wikidata PropertySuggester, outperforming it in all evaluated metrics. Notably we could reduce the average rank of the first relevant recommendation by 71{\%}.",

	abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2018 International Workshop on Learning Representations for Big Networks (BigNet@WWW2018). This is the third edition of the BigNet workshop series, following its inauguration at the 25th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2016) and the second edition at the 26th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2017). Recent years have witnessed the emergence of network representation learning research. Different from the feature engineering process in conventional analysis, network representation learning, also know as network embedding, aims to learn the latent low-dimensional representations for objects in networks, such as nodes, links, and groups. Its ultimate objective is to encode networks' structural properties into the latent representations, benefiting all existing network mining tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, community detection, etc. In the BigNet 2018 workshop, we aim to provide a forum for presenting the most recent advances in network representation learning to unearth rich knowledge.},
