* Support for www.paikkatietoikkuna.fi material


Known problems:
---------------

Problem: P_30f_1 
  With the Kansalaisen Karttapaikka, if a map is fetched
  with scale 1:16000 or higher from area that occupies
  area from two different KKJ-zones, Karttapaikka may
  return map data that has a white area on the other
  side of the zone border line and correct map data
  on the other side. As no error is returned, fetch_map
  considers this valid material and stores it to 
  cache. This may result to small white areas beside
  the KKJ-zone border line. This may be a 
  timing/concurrency issue in the Karttapaikka service. 
  
  Affected versions: all

  Fix: There is no fix for this problem at the moment.
  
  Workaround: remove the map tiles from map_cache that
  contain the white area besides the zone border line 
  and rerun the fetch_map script. The data usually comes
  ok the second time.    



Version 3.1i, 23.02.2012
------------------------
* Improved error handling with layer image loading in Retkikartta module.


Version 3.1h, 22.02.2012
------------------------
* Retkikartta module map cache directory layout had problems, corrected.


Version 3.1g, 20.02.2012
------------------------
* Completely rewritten KKJ coordinate transforms in coordinates 
  library according to JHS154 and JHS153.
* Corrected interface problems with Retkikartta layers.
* Introduced notification for new release version.
   
   
Version 3.1f, 10.02.2012
------------------------
* Small fixes to coordinate transforms
* Fixed a bug with layers and --cachedonly -parameter.
   
   
Version 3.1e, 06.02.2012
------------------------
* Release version with Retkikartta layer support and
  KMZ Google earth file format support
* Changed the coordinate module Finland area check to
  more accurate polygon implementation (provided area 
  is an approximation!) 


Version 3.1d, 05.02.2012
------------------------
* KML syntax tweaking for Garmin.


Version 3.1c, 04.02.2012
------------------------
* Added support for older KMZ calibration file without
  KML2.2 extensions.


Version 3.1b, 01.02.2012
------------------------
* Added support for KMZ calibration file type. (KMZ is 
  a Google Earth KML based format).


Version 3.1a, 30.01.2012
------------------------
* Added support for transparent info layers (--layer -option,
  at the moment supported only with retkikartta.fi).


Version 3.0m, 29.06.2011
------------------------
* Added support for FreeTrack calibration files.
* Correction to OziExplorer .map calibration file
  map projection setup with ETRS-TM35FIN material.


Version 3.0l, 10.04.2011
------------------------
* Added support for Kansalaisen Karttapaikka
  "Kiinteistöjaotus" option. When giving a parameter
  "--ktjraja" for KKP query, the result map image will
  contain real estate border lines. (experimental) 
  
 
Version 3.0k, 03.11.2010
------------------------
* Correction to MapInfo tab-file projection setup with
  ETRS-TM35FIN system.
* Retkikartta.fi had changed the map scale values. 
  Changed fetch_map to support the same new scale names.


Version 3.0j, 27.09.2010
------------------------
* Support for changed Retkikartta.fi platform.
* Minor changes to module interface.
* Map calibration file (.map) changed to use UTM map projection with 
  ETRS-TM35FIN system.


Version 3.0i, 05.08.2010
------------------------
* Increased iteration area for Lon value in KKJxy_to_KKJlalo 
  function in coordinates-module. Does not affect normal
  operation in Finland area.


Version 3.0h, 10.02.2010
------------------------
* Problem P_30g_2 fixed. 

* Added ETRS-TM35FIN conversions from and to WGS84 to 
  coordinates library.

* Changed KKP fetch map service to use the new 
  ETRS-TM35FIN coordinates used at the moment in the 
  Kansalaisen Karttapaikka.

* Added possibility to use ETRS-TM35FIN coordinates in the
  command line parameters



Problem: P_30g_2 (10.2.2010)
----------------------------
  Kansalaisen Karttapaikka is not working at the moment
  with current Fetch_map versions. The coordinate representation
  in Karttapaikka has changed to ETRS-TM35FIN grid coordinates.
  Fetch_map will have to be altered to work with the new
  coordinate system. The transormation and development work
  with Fetch_map is currently active. 

  Retkikartta.fi map service works ok with current versions of Fetch_map.

  Affected versions: all before v3.0h

  Fix: fixed in v3.0h
  
  Workaround: none


Version 3.0g, 14.08.2009
------------------------
* Added option to generate overlapped images automatically. 
  In addition to map center and dimensions, user gives
  the number of sheets in the overlapping map grid and
  the amount the sheets overlap eachother. Script generates
  multiple map images that are overlapped by the given 
  overlap distance. Map images are named in grid:
  Imagename_x_y.png

* Added support for GPSU GUX calibration file format.


Version 3.0f, 17.06.2009
------------------------
* Added informational printouts when fetching images.
  Script first executes a trial round to generate the
  map image and to calculate the number of map tiles
  in the image, cached tiles and tiles to download.

* Added KKP 1:8000000 scale, removed 1:12000000
  as it was no longer available.
   

Version 3.0e, 26.03.2009
------------------------
* Correction to Retkikartta.fi service code.


Version 3.0d, 23.03.2009
------------------------
* Correction to Retkikartta.fi service code.


Version 3.0c, 01.03.2009
------------------------
* Corrections to accuracy of ESRI world and MapInfo calibration.

* Added check to KKP fetching for the actual coordinates 
  returned from the service. In some rare cases the service 
  returns different area that was requested.


Version 3.0b, 19.02.2009
------------------------
* Changes to the map construction mathematics and calibration.   


Version 3.0a, 18.02.2009
------------------------
* Support for retkikartta.fi. A lot of changes to the 
  script code and structure to support multiple 
  map services.   


Version 2.0f, 27.08.2008
------------------------
* Bug fix. Esri world calibration file save did not work
  correctly with map scale 1:2000.


Version 2.0e, 08.08.2008
------------------------
* Bug fix. With --corners option there were possible coordinate
  calculation problems if corner coordinates given were on different 
  KKJ zones.


Version 2.0d, 30.06.2008
------------------------
* Support for new scales (1:2000, 1:4000, 1:8000) of
  Karttapaikka. Scale 1:16000 still the default.

* Experimental support for airplane pictures from Karttapaikka
  (--orto -parameter).
  

Version 2.0c, 26.02.2008
------------------------
* Fine tuned the temporary file handling when retrieving
  the map image from map service. Windows rename was not
  able to rewrite to the map cache. Using shutil.move now.
  
  
Version 2.0b, 25.02.2008
------------------------
* OziExplorer map calibration file save is now again by default.
  Other formats available using the --save option.
  
* Given coordinates are now checked to be approximately in Finland
  area before starting the map image generation.  

* Changed the map image retrieval process a bit. Now the image is
  first retrieved to a temporary file and processed there before
  moving to the correct map_cache location. It was possible to 
  create corrupted map cache images before if the script was
  interrupted in the wrong place or the processing failed of
  some reason.
  
* It was possible - though very unlikely - that the script
  was caught in an infinite loop generating the map image.
  This was due to calculation of the gathered map image
  when the missing piece was smaller than the aspect ratio
  of the map images. Corrected the bug.
  

Version 2.0a, 15.02.2008
------------------------
* Corrected the Karttapaikka scaling implementation to 
  new 600x600 picture image size.

* Added support for WGS84 coordinates in the command line
  parameters.

* Added parameter for the cache directory to be used.

* Added parameter for offline usage (--cachedonly). With this
  parameter the script does not retrieve new map images from
  the map service but uses only images in the cache. Missing
  areas are filled with yellow background.

* By default the script does not save any calibration files
  any more. The calibration file types are selected using
  --save option on the command line. Multiple types can 
  be given by giving multiple --save options.

* Map coordinates can be given also by giving map bottom left
  and top right coordinate pairs instead of center point
  coordinates, width and height (--corners -option).

* Map cache now stores map images under directory structure
  using also a location based hash algorithm.

* Moved watermark images from the map_cache directory to lib 
  directory.


Version 1.3e, 31.10.2006
------------------------
* The script writes a log to the map cache directory
  of the fetch commands executed.


Version 1.3c-d, 30.10.2006
--------------------------
* Small change to default values when the wm is not detected.


Version 1.3b, 28.10.2006
------------------------
* Corrected a small bug.


Version 1.3a, 28.10.2006
------------------------
* Script now adds _one_ watermark back to the final picture. 
* Corrected some minor issues with error handling.
* Changed the math a bit for the watermark detection.


Version 1.2a, 28.08.2006
------------------------
* Corrected the broken support for map scales.


Version 1.1a, 23.08.2006
------------------------
* Changed to support new version of Kansalaisen Karttapaikka
  (released 22.08.2006)


Version 1.0a, 11.06.2006
------------------------
* Corrected minor spelling error in the output.
* Added random delay between the map part downloads.
* Added support for delaying the download start to given
  time of day (--starttime option).
* Added support for retrying map part download on failure.


Version 0.9a, 04.06.2006
------------------------
* Fixed a miscalibration issue in the OziExplorer
  map file save function. Old version did a false
  assumption that Lat/Lon coordinates are also
  in rectangular grid, which is not true.


Version 0.8a, 29.12.2005
------------------------
* Fixed a small difference in the OziExplorer map
  file format. Old format worked with Ozi and
  SmartComGPS (ones that I have tested), but some
  third party software had problems with extra
  spaces.


Version 0.7a, 14.10.2005
------------------------
* Added support for KKJ bands 0 and 5. Eastern parts of
  Finland were not working properly.


Version 0.6a, 03.10.2005
------------------------
* Corrected bug in Mapinfo calibration file format.


Version 0.5a, 01.10.2005
------------------------
* OziExplorer calibration file improved to include correct KKJ-band 
  (formerly it used YKJ-band for all maps)
* Included changes from Mikko Syrjï¿½'s code and suggestions:
  + support for more map picture output
    formats (whatever PIL-library version supports)
  + new optional command line parameter (--palette) to convert
    the result image from true color to palette mode.
    This will reduce the size of the image on disk,
    but also the picture quality might be affected.
  + script outputs also Arcview and MapInfo calibration
    files (additional calibration file save functions
    by Mikko Syrjï¿½ <mikko@3d-system.fi>)
* Coordinates will be converted to proper KKJ band
  automatically if --force-coordinates -option is not
  given in the command.
* Added and updated functionality to the coordinates-library.


Version 0.3a, 09.09.2005
------------------------
* Added capability to fetch other scales than 1:16000.


Version 0.2a, 06.09.2005
------------------------
* Map was twisted if coordinate band border was in the middle of the map 
  picture. Changed the way the script fetches the image from the Karttapaikka.


Version 0.1a, 05.09.2005
------------------------
* First public version
