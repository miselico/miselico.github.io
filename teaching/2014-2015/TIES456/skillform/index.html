<tr><td><p>Java</p></td><td><p>Used a lot in practice. Very familiar with the core language features. Knowledge of specific libraries. Limited knowledge of JavaEE specifics.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Go</p></td><td><p>Used a couple of times for writing service related and scientific software. It is a small language, so quite familiar with the language features.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Python</p></td><td><p>Used in several small projects. One of the first programming languages I learned. Not a big fan any longer because of the 'missing' type system and need for extensive testing to catch problems which a compiler would catch.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Ruby</p></td><td><p>Used in course context only. It feels a bit overflexible.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>C/C++</p></td><td><p>Mainly theoretical knowledge. Used only a couple of times in practical projects, mainly trough Qt</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>PHP</p></td><td><p>Used in a few practical projects when it was still a very dirty language. Nowadays the language has improved drastically, but I haven't been using it really. </p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Javascript</p></td><td><p>Mainly copy-paste 'experience'. Made some websites with the help of JQuery. Not my favorite language really, even though differential inheritance is a very interesting concept. </p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Oberon</p></td><td><p>The language used in my first bachelor year at the university, used in many courses back then. Despite the fact that I even wrote a graphics engine in Oberon, I managed to forget most of it. </p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Haskell</p></td><td><p>I took the functional programming course at the university of Jyväskylä. No practical usage up till now.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Basic/QBasic</p></td><td><p>The first programming languages I learned, programming on a PC compatible with a 8088. Unfortuanelty, most of the code seems lost.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>git</p></td><td><p>Used for many projects ranging from coding to writing academic papers.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Maven</p></td><td><p>Used for many projects, but only as a dependency manager.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>XML and JSON</p></td><td><p>Used in many practical projects, mainly using Java as a programming language.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>HTML+CSS</p></td><td><p>Used for making a few websites, technical understanding is good. I have only once managed to make an appealing website. I would be a horrible web designer.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>REST</p></td><td><p>I have been implementing clients and servers for REST web services</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>SOAP/WSDL/JAX-WS</p></td><td><p>Same experience as REST. I have also created a services myself. </p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Protocol buffers</p></td><td><p>Mainly theoretical knowledge and used to test it out. Not used in a practical project yet.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>OpenID</p></td><td><p>Only used as a “customer”. Wrote a couple of small web applications which used it for authentication of students (on google app engine).</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>OAuth</p></td><td><p>LinkedIn, facebook and twitter were all using OAuth 1 or 2 as their authentication scheme at some point. I implemented authentication to these services using libraries.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Virtual Machines</p></td><td><p>I use VMs all the time during my work to test new features and maintaing development environments.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Map-reduce algo</p></td><td><p>Mainly theoretical knowledge. During my work I have not run into a proper use case yet.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>AWS</p></td><td><p>Amazon Web Services is the biggest provider of cloud infrastructure. I have an account there and have been playing around with VMs on their cloud and tried many of their services. I also received several grants for use of their services during my courses.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>SSH</p></td><td><p>I use SSH nearly every day. Also some knowledge about tunneling, etc</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>VNC</p></td><td><p>VNC is a protocol like remote desktop. I used to use it before I started using SSH X-forwarding. Actually at the time when I was still using Apple computers on daily basis.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Linux</p></td><td><p>In daily use. I have been trying a couple of distributions, but ended up as an Ubuntu user, mainly because its large user base makes it easier to find support. 
I am using the <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">Awesome window manager</a></p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p>Windows</p></td><td><p>Practical experience in opening and closing. Both left and right turning windows were used in many projects. 
I am currently taking this more advance course <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wof0xPUmW38">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wof0xPUmW38</a>.
Not too sure whether it will still be relevant with the new metro interface.
About the operating system: I was doing various tasks using Windows while working at the IT services department of an educational institute. 
(installing, cloning, maintenance scripts, active directory (mainly trough LDAP), etc.  )
