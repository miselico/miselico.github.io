Cloud Services
========================

Goal
----
In this exercises we will look at the different products offered by a cloud service provider
In particular different groups will try out different products and present their findings in the final lectures.

Prerequisites
-------------

Find out what [availability zones are in aws](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) .
Try to log in to aws. First you need to get your personal password from [http://ties456aws.appspot.com](http://ties456aws.appspot.com).



Task
----
Your task is depending on what topic your group picks. 
While you are doing the task you have to keep the following things in mind:

* How does it work?
* What do you have to pay? How is the pricing? Are there hidden costs?
* How expensive is this particular thing?

Then you make a cost estimate and add it to the README.txt file in the repository for this week.
Also add all code artifacts to the repository.

During the last review session, each group is supposed to give a short presentation about the what the service is, how much it costs and what you did with it.

Depending on the task you will work in a given availability zone.

* [AWS OpsWorks](https://console.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/home?#firstrun) DevOpsApplication Management Service
    * Make a set-up similar to the one described in the [getting started video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnWJsS4Y2c)

    * Implement a map reduce job on top of this infrastructure
    * You can base your application on [this article with a word count example](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/2273) but you should use another problem and a custom reducer.
    * Use a dataset with a size big enough to have a realistic running time for instance from [freely available data sets](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets)
    * Availability Zone : US West (N. California)
    * group 8

    * Provide a small web-interface to perform searches
    * Availability Zone : Asia Pacific (Sydney)
    * group 7
* [Elasticache](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/home) In memory cache in the cloud
