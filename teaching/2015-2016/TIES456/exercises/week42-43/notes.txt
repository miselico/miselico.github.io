Setting up the databases used to include setting up multiple nodes on one host. However, I could not get it running with the newest Riak version myself. Thus left out. 
If I get it running next time, it could be put back.


4. Now, you should run the database server. See [Running multiple Nodes on one host](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/basic-cluster-setup/#Running-Multiple-Nodes-on-One-Host).
Create three nodes for the server machine on the same host. 
In a real environment the nodes would be on separate machines, but to reduce repetition of the steps for the exercise they are created in one machine. 
You must configure the ports as follows (`http` ip and `pb_ip` are initially set to `127.0.0.1` and should be the same for the three nodes and is the IP of the database VM.):
    <style>
    tr:first-child    { background-color:#889ea5; } 
td:nth-child(odd)    { background-color:#eee8d5; }
td:nth-child(even)    { background-color:#fff; }
    </style>
    <table>
    <tr><th>Node</th><th>nodename</th><th>`listener.protobuf.internal`</th><th>`listener.http.internal`</th><th>`handoff.port`</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Node 1</td><td>riak1@127.0.0.1</td><td>192.168.122.1XX:8087</td><td>192.168.122.1XX:8098</td><td>8101</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Node 2</td><td>riak2@127.0.0.1</td><td>192.168.122.1XX:8088</td><td>192.168.122.1XX:8099</td><td>8102</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Node 3</td><td>riak3@127.0.0.1</td><td>192.168.122.1XX:8089</td><td>192.168.122.1XX:8100</td><td>8103</td></tr>
    </table>
Note that the `handoff.port` configuration setting has to be added to the configuaration file. 
If riak does not start, and everything seems configured correctly, check whether you still have free diskspace on the vm.
